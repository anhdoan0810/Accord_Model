Vehicle Interior and Restraint Modeling

EDAG, Inc., developed a full vehicle finite element model (FEM) including a vehicle interior and occupant restraint systems for the driver and front-seat passenger. The resulting FEM represents a model year  2014 Honda Accord mid-size sedan. In a subsequent contract that used this model, researchers at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) identified a deficiency in the passenger airbag model and developed an improved model with support from the ZF Group. The Updated Accord Model below includes this improved passenger airbag model.
